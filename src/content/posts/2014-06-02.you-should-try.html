<p>You may say I have nothing<br>
You may say I have something<br>
It comes from your eye<br>
Baby, you should try</p>

<p>Keep my eyes open<br>
Walking through the line<br>
Try not to look down<br>
Baby, you should try</p>

<p>Don’t carry on<br>
For what I’ve done<br>
Cause I’ll be home<br>
Baby, you should try</p>

<p>Stranded in blue<br>
Where they’re all gone<br>
But still I need some<br>
Baby, you should try</p>

<p>I’m not what you are<br>
Baby, you should try</p>

<p>When I was there<br>
Where they’re all gone<br>
When I’m on my own<br>
Baby, you should try</p>
